          <li>Bloodborne 
            <p>This is one of the most fun and most annoying games i have ever played, 
            it is extremely hard but also really rewarding and you feel acomplished after defeating a boss.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Rust
            <p>I have over 700 hours in this game and out of everyone i have played with i could not trust any of them, every single person in this game is toxic and a liar,
              but is really fun to blow of the base of someone who killed you and 
            </p>

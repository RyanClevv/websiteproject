            <h2>Bloodborne</h2>
            
            <p>This is one of the most fun and most annoying games i have ever played, 
            it is extremely hard but also really rewarding and you feel acomplished after defeating a boss. (10/10)</p>

            <h2>Rust</h2>

            <p>I have over 700 hours in this game and out of everyone i have played with i could not trust any of them, every single person in this game is toxic and a liar,
              but is really fun to blow of the base of someone who killed you and steal all of their stuff. (8/10)

            <h2>Terraria</h2>
            
            <p>I have beat this game multiple times and its different everytime and never feels like the same thing, which is great.
               This game is also fun, although the first 1-2 of the game are extremly boring and grindy. (9/10)</p>

            <h2>Sea of Thieves</h2>
            <p>I always meet really cool people on this game and they always help me when i play.
               Its great solving treasure maps and digging chests up from under the ground. Its great playing as a pirate! (7/10)</p>

            <h2>Borderlands 2</h2>

            <p>I have many late nights playing this game trying to beat a raid boss and getting powerful weapons. 
              This game is extremly fun and i could play it for hours on end, i love the humor in it and the enemies you fight. (10/10)</p>

            <h2>Dying Light</h2>

            <p>This game has a great story and great gameplay, you can learn fun skills like drop kicking and there are many fun weapons that send zombies flying.
               The DLC is great and really adds to the story. I have played it on 3 different consoles and it has always been a fun time! (10/10)</p>
